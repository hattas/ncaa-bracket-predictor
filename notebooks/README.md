These Jupyter notebooks contain backend testing/experimentation for future implementation on the website.



"kaggle_predictor.ipynb" - This is the main notebook.  It is how we simulate and test the tourney with different indicators.  This file provides the basis for "bracket_generator.py" in the django project (django\app\generate_bracket.py)

"csv_generator.ipynb" - code for creating a master csv file from all the data we have

"Graphs.ipynb" - experimenting with different indicators to see how they interact/correlate

"Statistical Method.ipynb" - experimenting with Ordinary Least Squares regression model to best indicators and weights
