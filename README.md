- once you have made changes to files, use `git add <filename>` to add files to be committed, i.e. `git add executor.py MovingAverageModel.py`

- use `git commit -m "commit message blah blah"` to commit the files you have added, including an appropriate commit message explaining what you have done

- use `git push`to sync your commits with the remote version of the repository

- use `git pull` to sync your local repository with the current version of the remote

- use `git reset --hard` to discard local changes so you can pull from github without conflicts
